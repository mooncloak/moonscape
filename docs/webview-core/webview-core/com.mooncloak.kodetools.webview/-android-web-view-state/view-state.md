# viewState

[android]\
var [viewState](view-state.md): [Bundle](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/os/Bundle.html)?

The saved view state from when the view was destroyed last. To restore state, use the navigator and only call loadUrl if the bundle is null. See WebViewSaveStateSample.
